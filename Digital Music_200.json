The Watergate break-in had not yet occurred, but faith in the U.S. Presidency had been eroding for several years. Crime as a matter of fact in daily life was slowly infecting the inner cities, following a decade marked by police brutality at the Watts riots in Los Angeles and the demonstration at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago (not to mention the National Guard at Kent State in 1970). The severe inflation of the mid to late-70s had not yet started to strangle the American economy, but that hardly made it any easier for those who were already suffering. Finally, the busing crisis, which attempted to integrate the races and ended up only dividing them further, was still on the horizon. Amid all of this, perhaps no single record in popular music more perfectly captured the transition from the idealistic 1960s to the painfully realistic 1970s than Marvin Gaye\'s What\'s Going On.As almost all before me have pointed out, the title of this album was not meant as an interrogative statment, but a declarative one. He was not asking listeners what was going on, he was telling them. And yet, one cannot help but detect more than a mere whiff of disbelief and helplessness in his voice when he sings the title track. In that sense, one is surely not too far off the mark in hearing the words "what\'s going on" being sung with a question mark after them, even if they are printed on the sleeve without one.The title track of Gaye\'s masterpiece sets the scene perfectly. When he sings "Brother, brother, brother, there\'s far too many of you dying", he is acutely aware that his fellow African-Americans accounted for a disproportionate number of the American troops in Vietnam. (Among whom was one of his own actual brothers, whose 3-year tour had ended in 1967.)  Furthermore, the cry of "Father, father, we don\'t need to escalate" none too subtley suggests both the generational differences over political issues, as well as the personal differences between Marvin Gay, Sr. and his son (let us not forget how Marvin Gaye met his untimely death). Finally, the lyric "who are they to judge us/simply cause our hair is long?" rings a true note of solidarity with hippies, most of whom were white. In his own search for hope, Gaye embraces pure religion ("God Is Love", "Wholy Holy") rather than an amorphous spirituality, be it drug-induced or otherwise. But still, he is not so naive as to deny his own dependence on drugs or that of those around him ("Flyin\' High"), which exists - at least in part - because of all of the things that he sings about on this album, and for the sake of escaping them.The record closes with one of the best performances of his career, "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)", which serves to remind the listener one-by-one of the issues addressed by whole songs throughout the record. In terms of these issues, specifically the one on "Mercy Mercy Me", Gaye could really only take solace in the fact that the Clean Air Act, the EPA, and Earth Day were all established in 1970. While Gaye clearly had his finger on the pulse of the times, he was also very much aware of the consequences of the things he knew would never disappear as if they had never existed. Thus, if hope was more or less gone for the current generation of adults, we were at least obligated to "Save the Children".What\'s Going On gave Motown a voice of protest, and a musical document as prophetic as anything Bob Dylan ever recorded. On "Inner City Blues", Gaye proclaimed, "God knows where we\'re heading". This is a particularly interesting statement coming from him. Considering that some of the worse crises of the 1970s were still to come, Marvin Gaye seemed to have a pretty good idea himself.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': '"God Knows Where We\'re Heading" (and so did Marvin Gaye)', 'unixReviewTime': 1159228800, 'reviewTime': '09 26, 2006'}

This album was released in 1976, but somehow each and every song sounds crisp and fresh.

Though those tracks were released, each and every song is worth listening to and Wonder obviously put time into each track. My personal favorite song is the amazing "Knocks Me Off My Feet." Everything about this song is great from the melody to the magnificent production, namely the piano chords. "As" sends chills through me with every listen. This song was sampled by a rapper named Nonchalant; she called her version "Until the Day." The lyrics to "As" are very profound. "Ebony Eyes" is another highlight. This song immediately grasps your attention and holds it until song\'s end.If "Songs in the Key of Life" is not in your collection, I don\'t know what\'s wrong; you need to add it quickly!

The only real downside to this CD is the decidedly simple arrangements.  The group went so far to create fresh and interesting structures, but there isn't much happening instrumentally outside of a drumbeat and a couple layers of bleeping.

I like the instrumental verse in the middle of the song, as well as the stereo effects on the vocals near the end, with the "So many people" chant on the right channel and the "Lost In A Lost World" chant on the left (Best experienced through headphones)."When You\'re A Free Man" is an equally fine Mike Pinder song, and there is a sense of hope in the lyrics ... I love the one line that states:"You know that love lasts ... For Eternity...Let\'s be God\'s Children ... And live in Perfect Peace"I love how the instrumentation in the fadeout to this track merges with the fade-in of the drums in the intro to "I\'m Just A Singer (In A Rock And Roll Band)." Both this superb John Lodge composition and Justin Hayward and Graeme Edge\'s "You And Me" are excellent rockers that open up and close the second half of this album ... The brass effects on the former track are really neat and give the song that extra "punch," plus the group chant on the Justin and Graeme composition, before the lyrics "You\'re an ocean full of faces" is executed to perfection!Both Justin\'s "New Horizons" and "The Land Of Make Believe" have a dreamy atmosphere about them, especially "Make Believe" (Beautiful xylophone effects and flute). Excellent dueling electric guitars (Also best experienced through headphones) on the solos to "New Horizons," as well. :)For me, Ray Thomas\' pleasant "For My Lady" paints the picture of a man on a cruise boat with the woman of his dreams! I love the way the song flows into John Lodge\'s fantastic "Isn\'t Life Strange," as both songs are played in the same chord ... Both Justin and John do an excellent job trading off vocals, and the harmonies sound nice on the choruses. I\'m glad that this remastered edition of the album (As well as "Time Traveller") features a clean fadeout of the song that doesn\'t abruptly merge into the intro to "You And Me," like the earlier CD format of the album, released in the 1980\'s, did. To go off on a slight tangent for a bit, I\'m probably one of the few (Or maybe the only one) listeners who enjoys the 1989 orchestral remake of "Isn\'t Life Strange," from "Legend Of A Band," just as much as the original version!It\'s difficult for me to pick a favorite on this recording, since I enjoy all eight songs equally!

In the 1988-91 era, though, the amount of power ballads and less heavy hit rockers increased, as did many good, but second-rate bands which may have only had a few memorable songs.Unfortunately come 1989, Danger Danger got lumped in with that category. At first, I can see why. Many of the songs do sound the same, it's pop and not very heavy at all (for metal standards). However, that said, I also think the wrong songs got picked as singles, as many of the non-hits are actually WAY stronger.1. Naughty, Naughty -- The leadoff medium synth hard rocker is good but a bit generic of this style. Loud but not threatening guitars, dirty lyrics about a 'naughty' girl. They were probably playing it safe by releasing this as a single.2. Under the Gun -- This fun but midly serious tune is far better. Starting out a little dark and becoming an uptempo pop/hard rocker.3. Saurday Nite -- Hard rocker about partying and cruisin'. Lyrics are very typical of this style, and sounds like a heavier version of a 1985 Loverboy album track, coincidentally called &quot;Friday Night.&quot; I guess they moved it up a day after a few years.4. Don't Walk Away -- A keyboard heavy slightly uptempo power ballad about telling a girl to not 'walk away' and give their love another shot. Even though this kind of song has also been done a million times by these bands, this is superior to many of them.5. Bang Bang -- These guys sure seem to like double titles! If I recall, this may also have been a minor hit. A less heavy rocker, now about one of the guys catching his girl cheating. Sequence-wise, it might sound wrong coming after the previous song, but no matter, it's still great fun.6. Rock America -- Extremely anthemic and keyboard driven fun tune. Though the &quot;I wanna rock/don't try to stop me&quot;-theme has been done to death, they sure do it good! A little soft to even be pop/metal. In fact, the opening vocals remind me of Mr. Mister's &quot;Kyrie!&quot; But I like that song too, so I'm not complaining. The rest sounds like Night Ranger.7. Boys Will Be Boys -- Yet another lite metal tune similar in theme to the previous song, but much less better this time around. Not bad, just less catchy.8. One Step From Paradise -- The softer power ballad. Nice, romantic tune about falling in love. Similar to &quot;Don't Walk Away&quot; but a bit happier.9. Feels Like Love -- Mid tempo poppy soft metal tune which is another in the line of shoulda been hits. Not very deep, but has a nice sound to it and very sing-a-long.10. Turn it On -- An energetic, 'in-love' song which is fairly catchy. If Survivor was a big hair band, I can visualise &quot;Is This Love&quot; sounding like this.11. Live it Up -- The quality dips a bit for the closing track. The pace is a little slower, but it's still hard rock, with the self-explanatory title.In short, there's a few songs that aren't as good, and to the casual listener, it might be hard to tell some of them apart. However, I think the problem with the lack of success is that the vocals sound tailored for a big hair metal band, whereas it seems that this material would've done better sung in a typical pop/hard rock style such as Loverboy.Also, if this had come out 5 or 10 years earlier, it could've been huge, especially on AOR radio. It actually sounds like it could've come from 1983 or so - resembling more of a Loverboy, Survivor and Aldo Nova sound. However, arriving toward the end of the hair metal craze, having more generic vocals, as well as a couple too many tracks sadly sealed this album (and band's) fate as being in the Slaughter/Trixter category.", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Great lite metal.

A plane crashed in Lake Monona near Madison, Wisconsin. Aboard were soul star Otis Redding & 4 members of the band The Bar-Kays. All but one Bar-Kays member perished in the crash. Otis, then on the verge of breaking through to pop audiences, was only 26 at the time. Naturally, with his death, unreleased recordings were released posthumously, probably more as a tribute to him than as a last-ditch attempt to cash in on his name. 1968\'s THE IMMORTAL OTIS REDDING was one of those rare posthumous albums that didn\'t tarnish the career Otis had worked so hard to build."[Sittin\' On] The Dock Of The Bay", of course, was recorded just 3 days before Otis\' death & became the first posthumous #1 hit of the rock era. It seemed that Otis was more popular in death than he was alive. The DOCK OF THE BAY album (1968) had its share of previously unreleased songs that were later released & became hits. Apparently, Otis was quite prolific, for the songs kept pouring out afterward & the appropriately-titled THE IMMORTAL OTIS REDDING is just even more icing on the cake.Unlike his absolute best album (and one of the greatest ever made) OTIS BLUE (1965), which mostly contained covers, IMMORTAL has more originals on it, proving Otis was just as accomplished a writer in his own right (he did, after all, write "Respect"!). The truly moving "I\'ve Got Dreams To Remember" (#41 pop, #6 R&B;)was co-written by Otis with his wife Zelma & considering that his death was just around the corner, it\'s enough to bring a tear to the listener\'s eye. The same goes for the traditional (but swingingly arranged by Otis) "Amen" (#36 pop, #15 R&B;), which had been a hit for the Impressions 5 years earlier. Otis\' version is just as heartfelt & proof that he hadn\'t forgotten his raising as a child of the church.Other somber tunes that didn\'t become hits include "A Waste Of Time" (a forgotten masterpiece of Southern soul), "Champagne & Wine", "You Made A Man Out Of Me", Ray Charles\' "A Fool For You" & "Think About It". This is definitely perfect midnight music to either mend your broken heart or give the one you love a little somethin\' (wink wink).But while Otis may be an expert at loving up a storm, he still has the equal ability at getting the listener up & moving. "Hard To Handle" (#51 pop, #38 R&B;) was no doubt exposed to a new audience thanks to the Black Crowes\' 1990 revival & I was even surprised to find that it was a cover. While the Crowes\' version is just as much their own, Otis\' version still moves like hell. "Nobody\'s Fault But Mine" (B-side to "Dreams)", "A Thousand Miles Away" & "The Happy Song" (#25 pop, #10 R&B;) work just as well at bringing up the dullest of parties.While the digging up of a deceased artist\'s unreleased material would border on the obscene & darn near disrespectful, with Otis Redding, it was clear that the music he hadn\'t released yet or still intended to work on further was just as good (and, in some cases, better) than what did get released. In fact, Otis had so much music left in the can, that 4 posthumous albums were released & the verdict is that it was indeed worth it (can anyone tell me if LOVE MAN has ever been released on CD?). THE IMMORTAL OTIS REDDING proves beyond the shadow of a doubt that while Otis may have left us at only 26, his music is indeed immortal & that probably he had plans to dazzle us with even more great music.

Sure I had heard of their mind blowing "Free Your Mind" and harmonizing funk of "Never Gonna Get My Love" from their highly acclaimed 1992 release "Funky Divas" but I never really delved into their music untill now. I brought "Born To Sing" at my local used music store and I was amazed at how fresh this album sounds even though this album is fifteen years old!En Vogue has a style that is sexy, brash and classy, not to mention their stellar vocal stylings which all four women mesh well together and never sound boring or competing. The women of En Vogue (Dawn, Cindy, Terri and Maxine) take turns sharing the spotlight on their 1990 debut and they all can hold their own.With a little help from Club Noveau (spell?-they brought you the remake of the Bill Withers classic "Lean On Me" and were once called the Timex Social Club which had a hit called "Rumors") members Thomas McElroy and Denzil Foster, En Vogue captures the esscense of early 90\'s New Jack with their debut.The hits were the street funky "Hold On" which features a nice little intro of the Jackson 5\'s "Who\'s Loving You" but seems out of place with the song itself. "Lies" was next with it\'s hip-hop New Jack piano and a female rapper named Debbie T. Then the harmonious "You Don\'t Have To Worry" and the drum machine drenched "Don\'t Go" summed up the biggest hits off the album and also the best songs off the album. The other tracks hold up well against the hits, such as the quirky and sharp "Strange" and the small interlude of the Andrews Sisters classic "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" which had a hip-hop flair to it and that I wished was longer. "Luv Lines" is another notable which features some great keyboard work and showcases some demanding singing from Dawn. And the bonus track "Waitin\' On You" features some sultry vocals from Cindy and a wonderful sax by late great sax player Grover Washington Jr. and the glorious remake of "Just Can\'t Stay Away" holds well with the original. Still there are some duds like the eerie "Part Of Me" which isn\'t great at times and it can be sleep enducing but still En Vogue take turns at singing lead on this one and I give them props for that. Also "Time Goes On" is verry annoying after a couple of listens especially with the repetative "Tick, Tock, Tick, Tock" it practically drove me insane at first listen!With some funny interludes ("Party" features the girls at a party being approached by some stupid guys, it\'s verry funny and it reminds me of some of the guys that approach me at parties-you do want to say "NOOO!"), harmonous vocals, toe-tapping music and a sense of style and class from these ladies you will fully enjoy "Born To Sing" if you buy it. I\'m now planning on purchasing "Funky Divas" and more En Vogue albums (though sadly Dawn left and the group it was never the same).

During these years, Rush mellowed quite a bit with the albums Signals (1982), Grace Under Pressure (1984), Power Windows (1985), Hold Your Fire (1987), Presto (1989), and Roll The Bones (1991).  Beginning with Counterparts (1993), Rush got back to their hard rock roots.Roll The Bones contains a lot of quality tracks, but my favorites are the instrumental "Where\'s My Thing?", "Neurotica", "Ghost Of A Chance", and "Face Up".  The song "Dreamline" is cool as well.  I don\'t care for the title track, which has a middle section that contains rap.  I don\'t like when bands feel the pressure of the marketplace and stray away from their signature sound and do what\'s popular at the time.  Some hard rock bands have inserted rap, disco, and other types of music into their albums that were released at the time this kind of stuff was popular.  An example is Blue Oyster Cult putting disco songs on their 1979 album "Mirrors".  Thankfully, the hard rock songs on that album help balance everything out, and I like the album overall.  I think that Rush\'s next album after Roll The Bones, the hard rocking Counterparts, is a result of their fans asking them to return to their roots after hearing mellow stuff and rap on Roll The Bones.  The same thing happened with Blue Oyster Cult.  They followed up Mirrors with the much harder Cultasaurus Erectus (1980), considered a comeback album by fans and critics.Roll The Bones is Rush\'s most upbeat album ever.  I swear, you can dance to most of the songs.  It has crystal clear sound as well.  It is very well produced, though sometimes I think it\'s overproduced.  In contrast, their previous album, Presto (1989), is somewhat depressing.  I think Rush deliberately made Roll The Bones upbeat so it would be the opposite of Presto.Overall, Roll The Bones is a solid album from Rush\'s mellow period.

They just never stopped no matter how much or how little funk is popular at any given time. After two creatively important albums in their debutEast Bay Greaseand the even more forward thinkingBump Citythe band released this third and self titled album in 1973. Their previous recording had found the band moving into a more well rounded and soulful sound than just one high octane horn fueled funk jam after another. And in terms of songwriting,arrangement and vocal harmonies alone this album found them officially at their musical peak.For one thing there\'s "What Is Hip?". With it\'s stuttering bass line and sharp horn breaks,it is one of the all time funk anthems of the 1970\'s. In terms of funk itself this album represents itself well on that front with one of my favorite jams here "Get Yo Feet Back on The Ground" and "Soul Vaccination",basically a follow up to "What Is Hip?". Actually there are no formal ballads on here either. Just slower paced grooves,interesting since funk has a slower tempo anyway on "Clever Girl","So Very Gard To Go" and "Just Another Day". "This Time It\'s Real" for it\'s part is basically a gospel inspired uptempo soul shuffle,not much to do with funk but gives some variety to their sound. "Will I Ever Find Love?" and "Both Sorry Over Nothing" have a heavier southern soul flavor to them to add to this soulful set.This is one of those recordings that actually sets up the musical pallete for the 70\'s funk album. It has the funk itself in fine form,slower grooves that are just somewhat more down tempo and vocal oriented variations on the faster songs and music that reflects that all important hybrid of funky soul. And from the very beginning,it\'s lyrics even seek to ask the same questions the music does. Somehow or other funk is so deep inside the veins of everyone in this band that it got into their identity completely.  Even during the disco era and on into the 80\'s they either lent out the famous TOP horn section to session work to pay the bills or flat out kept up with their classic sound. So that had funk reliability AND dependibility.

Leather Jackets has a couple of great songs on it however. Hoop of Fire, Slow Rivers and Paris could rank up there with the best of them.But the rest seem like leftovers (which many were from the previously released and ill-conceived Ice On Fire). Elton shares songwriting credits with Bernie Taupin, Cher and Gary Osbourne. Taupin doesn't seem to have much to say while Osbourne turns in yet another routine love song on Memory of Love.

The title track, in which Taupin evokes the great 50's rock stars gets the snythesizer treatment that buries a perfectly good lyric that could have been another homage to the genre like Crocodile Rock. Elton completely missed the point of Taupin's lyric here. Go It Alone, a wanna-be heavy rocker, sounds more like Bob Seger's Shakedown. And that's not a good thing.

A year and one week later, I got this expanded deluxe edition as a present, shortly after it had been released, and loved the album even more.  A good thing got even better, in spite of how I\'d embarrassingly and uncharacteristically believed the rantings of a certain group of audiomaniacs who are rather high-profile in the fan community.  I had been led to believe the sound on the remaster was garbage and that it was loaded with tinny muted sounds.  It turned out that there was nothing of the sort wrong with it.  If anything, the sound quality is even better, and while the sound is a bit lower on the second disc, that\'s because they turned their instruments down for the Tommy portion of the show.  The softer sound actually greatly enhances it, since that whole story benefits from a gentle and more acoustic sound.  Really, the only people whining about how this remaster sounds so horrible and is the work of the Devil are audiomaniacs.  What is so much better about their hearing that they can hear problems that no one else can detect, let alone enough to raise a ruckus over?In addition to sounding better than ever and having nearly the complete show, this reissue also has the full-length onstage commentary.  My favorite bit of onstage dialogue is Pete\'s long introduction to "AQO," which is just hilarious.  While some people prefer live albums to focus just on the music, I think having onstage banter adds to one\'s enjoyment of the show, makes it a more personal listening experience.  There are so many great performances here it\'s hard to select just a few favorites!  The Who really were better live than in the studio; while their studio albums are great too, the songs just take on a whole new dimension live, are transformed into something even better, totally different entities.  It is unfortunate, though, that the powers that be didn\'t include "Spoonful" on this latest incarnation and that a couple of minutes of the final two songs are missing.  I\'m also not keen on how Roger stepped back into the studio all those decades later to selectively resing the vocals on some of the later songs.  His voice was just fine on them on the original releases, and after such a long intense set, one expects a singer\'s voice to be a bit shot.  Additionally, as good as age has been to him, a 57 year old is not going to sound as good as a 25 year old.

Most of the time when I play an album this much I burn out on it in a couple of months. I'm not sure if I prefer this one or &quot;40 Oz. To Freedom&quot; though. For me, it's a tough call.

I was 12 years old when it first came out (does that date me???? I\'m old) and I listened to it INCEssently. In fact, this was my first exposure to R&B and I consider a fine first album to start with. The songs on here are great (kinda corny now that I listen to them again, some 22 years later) but the music is wonderful and the voices of these wonderful artists are so young full of life. They\'re not always perfect, and quite a few times on this album, someones voice crakcs, but thats what make this album so great.This is waaaaay before Bobby brown started smoking crack. Look at the album cover and you cant help but smile at how innocent and young these kids looked. And look at the cockeyed grim on Bobby Browns face. My favorite song on here, hands down, is Mr telephone man. The beat is fantastic and the story is so cute. It details the trials and tribulations of "love" when you were young. Oh, it was all so simple then. This whole album is about falling in love for the first time and having your heartbroken by the girl/boy that you were certain (CERTAIN) at the young age of 12 was the one for you. In fact, I listened to this album soooo much that we took a family trip to Arizona and I lay in the backseat of the car and listened to this tape (TAPE!!!!) on my walkman over and over and over, never once looking up to see the desert that my parents had taken us to see for the first time. To this day, my mom still brings that up....."I cant believe we went driving all the way out in the desert in Arizona to give you a new experience to tell your friends about, and you spent the whole time flat on your face in the backseat listening to a tape!!!!"

Born and raised in Nova Scotia, her recording career began with two highly acclaimed releases, "Solace" and "Touch". Partnering with producer Pierre Marchand, they created sounds, textures, lyrics and vocals that defied description. McLachlan\'s early work was experimental, giving her a cult following that labeled her as `alternative\'. "Fumbling Towards Ecstasy" was really the benchmark for her alternative audience, most of whom were shell shocked at the AC, mature sounds of her next two studio efforts "Surfacing" and "Afterglow". Though McLachlan can be credited for contributing deeply affecting lyrics and subtle intense vocals to the `alt\' sound, Marchand is really the orchestrator of the overall sound design that makes this effort a minor alternative masterpiece.What makes this such a unique and alternative recording? It is alternative in that it breaks new ground in making simple instruments like the Hammond B-3 and percussion sound fresh and new. It is alternative in that McLachlan and Marchand focus on a single audience and never try to please everyone. It is alternative in that the lyrics are raw and open for all to see and the vocals interpret these lyrics in varying degrees of intensity. Thus it is no surprise that most of her early success came on the alternative and rock charts before her music gained a wider audience on the pop and AC charts.This is a superb effort. The subtle but powerful opener "Possession" signals that the listener is in for a great ride of interpretive sounds. The hits "Good Enough" and "Hold On" though slow in their delivery, are understated gems. "Plenty" and "Mary" are great to listen to for their moving undertones of sadness and solitude. The key tracks here that make this CD stand out are "Possession" and the two final cuts - "Fear" and the title track, both of which are brilliantly written and produced, both cloaked in darkness that you can feel through the music - perfect. This remains McLachlan\'s best effort. Sure, she sold a ton of units with "Surfacing" and "Mirrorball" and gained a wider audience, but this is the recording that fans and followers always come back to - and they are right. It\'s raw, musically challenging, brilliantly produced and showcases McLachlan at her best.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Outstanding....And Still Her Best Effort To Date', 'unixReviewTime': 1106092800, 'reviewTime': '01 19, 2005'}

This set provides a comprehensive overview of his career from his years at RCA (which are really the only ones that matter to most people).The first CD is interesting. It is made up entirely of tracks from Rhymes and reasons, Take me to tomorrow, Poems prayers and promises and Aerie. These were his first, second, fourth and fifth albums. The third album (Who's garden was this?) is mentioned in the accompanying booklet, but is not represented here at all. The collection starts with Leaving on a jet plane, which John wrote before he was famous. It became a huge international hit for Peter Paul and Mary. The most famous track is Take me home country roads, but there are many other great songs here. I would like to have seen his cover of Buddy Holly's Everyday and something from that third album included, but I have no complaints about what has been included.The second CD is compiled from the next four original albums - Rocky mountain high, Farewell Andromeda, Back home again and Windsong. This was the period when John's popularity was at its peak. Many of his famous songs are on this CD, including Annie's song, Back home again, Sweet surrender, I'm sorry and Rocky mountain high. Thank God I'm a country boy, originally a track on Back home again, was later recorded live and that recording became another huge hit. It is that version which is included here, not the original studio recording.The third CD begins with one last track from Windsong - Calypso, a tribute to Jacques Cousteau.  During the period covered by this CD, John recorded two Christmas albums including one with the Muppets. Neither of these are represented here. So, the remainder of this CD contains tracks from Spirit, I want to live, John Denver (no other title) and Autograph. Although less successful than his earlier music, this was mainly due to changing public taste. The songs are brilliant.There are some great moments on the final CD, although lacking consistency. It was a decade of experimentation and change, but it yielded two superb duets - Perhaps love (with Placido Domingo) and Wild Montana skies (with Emmylou Harris). The albums represented on this CD are Some days are diamonds, Seasons of the heart, It's about time, Dreamland express and One world.This comprehensive collection contains many tracks not otherwise available on CD and is fitting tribute to a unique singer.", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Excellent retrospective', 'unixReviewTime': 1040428800, 'reviewTime': '12 21, 2002'}

I absolutley loved it then heard the next one that was so highly praised was Alien Lanes.  I went out and bought this album and felt like I had recieved on of the greatest rock albums made.  This album is extreemly addictive.  The music is very catchy and the lyrics are very prolific.  As long as I've been a GBVhead I have idolized Pollard.  The man makes you think and you just can't get his music out of your head.  This album was made when they were still in their lo-fi stage recording on 4-track so at times the sound is a bit rough but not to rough as it became on Vampire On Titus.  There really isn't a weak song on this whole collection and has 28 songs. A Salty Sallute starts the album off with a basic drum beat and driving bass line and as soon as Robert starts to sing we hear the GBV guitar kick in. Other favorites on this album would be Evil Speakers which sounds very much like garage rock.  Very upbeat song with catchy lyrics.  My Valuable Hunting Knife is the hit on here and is probably the most memorable or catchy.  This is one most of us fans will recomend you listen to if you are new to GBV.  Game Of Pricks is just a great dance song where if you were at a GBV show you couldn't help yourself from rocking along.  Blimps Go 90 is another great head rocker that you will end up singing along too.

Straight from the lyrics to mostly the production was mostly the wackest I\'ve heard from him. It\'s not as bad as many of the reviewers have been saying that makes you wish you were deaf. You\'ve heard more horrible albums believe it or not.Reading the reviews almost everyone who bashed Sean Combs, said something about beat jocking old 70\'s and 80\'s hits. True, I don\'t like the style at all. But have you noticed almost everyone, new and old, has "jocked" songs that were 15 years old and rapped over them. Puffy is not the first to cash in on this style, and surely won\'t even be the last. People crying when Puffy did it, but when someone else does it and raps over it, its a whole different ball game. He\'s just exploited in an unintentional way, by crossing the line. The stuff these people say. What really weighs the style down is the lyrics on the songs that he jocked (I\'m pretty sure you know which origonal beats he stole, so I won\'t get into it). Something tells me that he didn\'t put any thought into what he wrote down. An example is on one of the single\'s "Victory" as he says "...Put your money on the table and get your math on/break it down, split it up, get your laugh on/ see you later Dog, I\'ma get my stash on/ there\'s a bed full of money that I get my a** on..." Not very good lyrics, but you can\'t blame him for writing his "cashed in lyrics".Guest appearances, couldn\'t be more horrible. Well not exactly. It\'s hard to tell if Puffy outshines his guests or do they outshine him. With the exception of "Is This The End" and any song that his Big\'s vocals, you know exactly what I\'m talking about. Lets start with the first single "Can\'t No Body Hold Me Down" as come to learn that both Puffy and Mase makes the song look like a commercial joke (And the fact that Mase is immitating Grandmaster Flash on his verse, could have made the origonal look the same way). Foxy Brown\'s verse is horrible on the song "Friends" (like it made a difference). "Don\'t Stop What You\'re Doing" should have never seen the light of day. On some occasions there are some good guests. Black Rob\'s debut his decent as he raps the first two verses in the song "I Love You". The Lox\'s "I Got The Power" is somewhat decent as Puffy does the hook. The best song "Young G\'s" which features Notorious BIG and Jay-Z as each person spit one long verse. Also most of the verses (I said "most" meaning everything on the second verse that Kim and BIG says) on the biggest hit "All About The Benjamins". Puffy gives a somewhat tribute to the passed Notorious BIG on the song "I\'ll Be Missing You".No Way Out is the bad album most people says. Most of the rhymes are just halfassed to a certain point. I\'m not going to lie to myself and say that I hated this album, because when the videos came on the televison, I was happy as my child age to see them, no matter how overrated the album and the singles were. As one spolight reviewer says about hated the beat jocking but jumped on the dance floor when Puffy\'s songs came on. I would have done the same thing. I\'m no Bad Boy fan, but I\'m not going to point the finger at Puffy for his damage in rap.

Macca wanted to get back to the basics of rock & this is the product he created. It\'s his hardest rocking album. Back to the Egg was Sir Paul\'s ninth studio album & only made it to #8 on the charts. It\'s likely that the public had a negative reaction to this album because it didn\'t have most of the normal type of songs he records. That\'s sad because, though most will disagree, it\'s one of his best albums; not only that, but the version of Wings put together here was the most talented. Sir Paul even tried, in one sense, to catch lightening in a bottle by titling this album Back to the Egg. It was not only his way of saying he was going to get back to the basics of rock, the title was eerily similar to his most successful album, Band on the Run.Only two singles were released from Back to the Egg, they were "Arrow Through Me" went to #29 & "Getting Closer" managed to get to #20. With the exception of his debut album, McCartney, Back to the Egg was the first album of his not to have a #1 single. The first song is certainly more typical for McCartney; it has a great horn arrangement & was a perfect choice to close side one of the vinyl version. The second song was very UNtypical as a choice for a single by McCartney. Up to this point in his career it was the hardest rocking song released as a single Sir Paul did a grammy for "Rockestra Theme" for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. It wasn\'t a hit but it\'s the only song that even gets a little airplay anymore.Back to the Egg is loaded with good songs & good performances. The album opens with the short instrumental "Reception". It has a killer bass riff & has spoken words through out, not all entirely understandable. Deep down inside Sir Paul has had a desire to venture into Pink Floyd territory & this gets somewhat close to that.  The aforementioned "Getting Closer" is next followed by the acoustic "We\'re Open Tonight" which, like "Mrs. Vanderbilt" from Band on the Run, is a recurring theme. "Spin It On" follows & is one of the hardest rocking songs here; it even has elements of the burgeoning punk movement. Lead Player, Laurence Juber, shines on this one. The Denny Laine composition "Again and Again and Again" follows, it\'s the one song that I would consider dispensable on the entire album. It\'s probably the worst song that he wrote to appear on  a Wings album. "Old Siam, Sir" is next & also rocks very hard. Juber once again does an outstanding lead while Paul gives a very rough & gritty vocal similar to what he did on "Oh! Darling" from Abbey Road. "Arrow Throuh Me" & "Rockestra Theme" are next, then we get "To You" which rocks hard also but not up to the level of "Old Siam, Sir" or "Spin It On". One of my favorite songs on the album comes next, "After the Ball/Million Miles". It\'s two song fragments that Sir Paul put together (how often has he done that?), both have fragments have a gospel feel which has been one of the formative beginnings of rock music. McCartney gives excellent vocals on this reminding us just how good of a vocalist he can be. The next song "Winter Rose/Love Awake" are much more typical songs of Sir Paul & are average. "The Broadcast" is another short instrumental that has a spoken performance from a play inserted. "So Glad to See You Here" follows & is the second & last appearance of the Rockestra on the album. The Rockestra not only includes Wings (Laurence Juber- guitar, Denny Laine- guitar, Linda McCartney- keyboards & Paul on bass), there are a ton of guest musicians: Dave Gilmour (Pink Floyd), Hank Marvin (The Shadows & Cliff Richard), Pete Townshend (The Who), John Bonham (Led Zeppelin), Kenney Jones (The Who), John Paul Jones (Led Zeppelin), Ronnie Lane (Faces & Small Faces), Bruce Thomas (Madness & Elvis Costello), Gary Brooker (Procul Harum)& Tony Ashton (Family & Paice, Ashton & Lord). The original album ends with "Baby\'s Request"; it\'s one of those \'big band\' type songs that Sir Paul typically does one an album. It\'s not bad & has a killer guitar riff opening it.The reissue has three bonus tracks added: "Daytime Nighttime Suffering" a B-side from a single & two Christmas songs, "Wonderful Christmastime" & "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reggae", both are utterly dispensable.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Back to the Egg', 'unixReviewTime': 1194393600, 'reviewTime': '11 7, 2007'}

I've been through many different listening phases.  I used to wonder, with angst, why my favorite artist wasn't popular, then some of them became popular.  I decided I didn't like that very much at all.  I didn't like my favorite artist to be same as the teeny bopper's who wore their T-shirt. I've since become more of a fan of the artist, as opposed to being a fan of the song.  I still get burned every once in awhile, but for the most part if you're lucky enough to find the artist you'll rarely be disappointed by the song.  Within the past ten years I've landed on a few artists who could sing the phone book and have me enthralled.  They are Mike Patton and everything he's connected with (see Mr. Bungle, FNM, Fantomas and Tomahawk), Richard Ashcroft and everything he's connected with (see The Verve), and Steve Malkmus (see Pavement).  Linous is a part of that upper echelon for me.  He's a little more unusual than those mentioned above, save for Patton, but he has an integrity to his work that is so compelling that it enhances what could otherwise be considered offbeat.  In other words, Linous is not unusual for the sake of being unusual.  He can be unsettling (Pig). He can be sensual (Paintbirds). He can be contemplative (Saint Mary). He can rock (Sick of Goodbyes).  You get the idea.  He's the kind of artist who presents you with a different color, and a different paint stroke, with each song.  Good Morning Spider is one of those few albums I've found that I can sleep to, exercise with, and write during.  Vivadixie may be a better starting point, but this album will be the one you stick with, and the one to which you finish your Linous phase.

I also had been hearing a lot of buzz concerning this album's release, which also helped to fuel my desire to purchase it as soon as possible. So when I got it I was expecting a lot out of the album. What I got was a remarkable piece of work that blew away my expectations.The album starts thumping with the heavy hitting, but very odd &quot;Prison Song&quot;, in which the vocalist changes voices several times and once sounds like a nasal Fred Durst. Then comes &quot;Needles&quot; and &quot;Deer Dance&quot; which both have thundering guitars and a very fast drum beat. They also both have beautiful if not odd vocals with amusing, but poignant lyrics. &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; starts out fast then slows down slightly, then picks it up again and continues this way until the end of the song. Has beautiful vocals though, probably one of the best tracks vocally. &quot;X&quot; is a heavy song, that starts out slow, then kicks into some super-high gear, with anthemic lyrics. Good song. &quot;Chop Suey&quot; is a very good song, great mix of speedy beats and acoustic sections. A beautiful song, believe it or not. &quot;Bounce&quot; is another fast song, but seems less serious than those before it, similar to &quot;Prison Song.&quot; Decent song, one of the weaker tracks. &quot;Forest&quot; does not have the punk beat, the earlier songs have, but is still a good song. Great vocals and lyrics, sounds similar to Tool. &quot;ATWA&quot; starts extremely slow, but kicks in during the &quot;I don't feel it anymore&quot;, and repeats the cycle. Another excellent song vocally and lyrically. &quot;Science&quot; is a cool song that slows down in the middle, then the hammering guitars and drums kick back in with Serj's anthemic vocals. The lyrics seem to convey that he believes religion over science. &quot;Shimmy&quot; is another odd song similar to &quot;Prison Song&quot; and &quot;Bounce&quot;, better than the latter. Cool lyrics make this a memorable song. &quot;Toxicity&quot; is a poignant song with powerful lyrics and pounding guitars. &quot;Psycho&quot; is melodic song that talks about cocaine adicts. One of the best tracks on the album. &quot;Aerials&quot; is a harmonious blend of stunning vocals and moving guitar work. The best song on the album, incredible lyrics, great way to end this brilliant album. After the song there is some odd tribal music, not really worth the time to listen to, though.As a band the musicians are top-notch creating beautiful metal riffs and punk beats.

I have yet to hear all of 'Songs In The Key Of Life', 'Fulfillingness First Finale' or 'Music Of My Mind'...but so far 'Talking Book' is my front runner. (Note: I only own &quot;Hotter Than July&quot;, &quot;Talking Book&quot;, and &quot;Innervisions&quot;)The album starts off with &quot;You Are The Sunshine Of My Life&quot;, a subdued, mellow hit. This version is slightly different than the one found on 'Original Musiquarium: Volume 1' as there is less instrumentation. The second song, &quot;Maybe Your Baby&quot; is ominously funky...it's about losing a lover to infidelity; the tone of this song is tragically comedic -- as if, when one has been hurt so badly, all one can do is laugh. I like &quot;Maybe Your Baby&quot; alot.An early climax to this album arrives in the form of &quot;You and I&quot;, an incredibly powerful ballad, along the lines of &quot;Butterflies&quot; (a song that can be found on Spike Lee's &quot;School Daze&quot; soundtrack). &quot;You and I&quot; is first of the two stunningly beautiful &quot;breaking-up&quot; ballads featured on this album. &quot;Tuesday Heartbreak&quot; is an agreeable, somewhat celebratory sounding midtempo. &quot;You've Got It Bad&quot; is in my humble opinion, a quaint forerunner of 'Innervisions' material like &quot;Jesus Children of America&quot;. Next up is &quot;Superstition&quot;...I'm assuming everyone reading this review has heard &quot;Superstition&quot; at least once in their lifetimes!&quot;Big Brother&quot; is the song that gave birth to Arsenio Hall. Okay, not literally, but the mention of the name &quot;Arsenio&quot; did indeed inspire his parents. Featuring sparse instrumentation (guitars, drums, and the trademark harmonica), the song seems to confront opportunistic politicians who took (and perhaps still take?) advantage of the plight facing inner-city Americans. &quot;Blame It On The Sun&quot; is the second beautiful &quot;break-up&quot; ballad on 'Talking Book', and I can't get enough of this one...&quot;Lookin For Another Love&quot; has that same warm and fuzzy feeling that &quot;Superwoman Pt. 1&quot; has; thematically this is the first time things seem to get better on this overwhelmingly sad and moving masterpiece. We end on an optimistic note, with the stridently confident &quot;I Believe (When I Fall In Love, It Will Be Forever)&quot;...All in all, as a 24-year old music critic trying to understand the music industry that came before me, I'm surprised that 'Talking Book' hasn't garnered the kudos over time that 'Innervisions' has, according to my informal research.

Believe me when I say, this album is phenomenal, monumental and POWERFUL! This is truly a fascinating album and this album clearly shows how talented the orchestra is. Producer, Paul O\'Neil has done it again! The orchestra is at the top of their game on this album.  The vocals are incredible, and the orchestra, especially the guitarists are incredible throughout the entire album. The album is very diverse with a great mix of power ballads, instrumentals and opera.Some of the greatest highlights of this album are these fine tunes. The opening into, "Overture" is short intrumental piece that has clips from track 11, "Requiem (The Fifth)" included. The next track, "Midnight" is an excellently written ballad  with an excellent array of intrumental pieces. Track 6, "What Is Eternal" is another ballad that is sung by a male vocalist with extrordinary talents. The next track, "Vienna" is another classic ballad from this album. Truly a masterpiece. Track 10, my personal favorite ballad from the album is, "The Dreams of Candlelight." The female vocalist does an excellent job capturing the love of this lyrics in this song. The song is the second greatest ballad of the album. The lyrics are top-notch here and are very warm and heartfelt.The next track, the greatest instrumental, "Requiem (The Fifth)" is outstanding. Everybody knows the requiem. With the lead guitar taking over the high chords of the instrumental, the intrumental is fantastic. The guitars are loud and just blow you away. The orchestra captured Beethoven\'s most famous piece perfectly. The next track, "I\'ll Keep Your Secrets" is another monumental ballad from the album. The song is about a woman that will be by Beethoven\'s side during his last moments when he dies and after he\'s gone, she will keep the secrets of his life alive. The female vocalist on this song is truly magnificent. The next track, "The Dark" is the POWER-BALLAD of the album. The same female vocalist as the previous track does an even better job on this song. The instrumental pieces of this song are the best they have ever been throughout the album. This is one of my personal favorites from this album. Listen to the MP3 sample to see what I mean. Jumping a few tracks to number 21 is, "Who Is This Child." This song is the story of Beethoven\'s sacrifice for a lonely child out on the street that the Devil threatened to harm if he didn\'t give the Devil the Tenth Symphony. Paul O\'Neil did an excellent job putting the story into a musical piece.Without a doubt, this album is truly magnificent! Everything about the album is phenomenal. The vocals, the orchestra, the ballads, the lyrics, and the instrumentals are all outstanding. Believe me when I say, this album is so good that you dont\' even have to listen to the MP3 sample!

First of all, she\'s BEAUTIFUL. If you mixed Mystic, Iman, Lisa Bonet, and Sade into one, you have Lamya. She\'s a fox, to put it shortly. :-) She has a different premise. Her sound was hyped to be a cosmic, eccentric blend between spaced out poetry and World sounds mixed with rock and hip hop flourishes. Plus she was a former background singer for Soul II Soul as well as James Brown and David Bowie. And...to add icing to the cake, she\'s signed by Clive Davis to his J Records imprint. And everyone knows that Davis knows how to ram an artist down the public\'s throat ( a certain braided "pianist"- singer whose name rhymes with Kaleesha Blees- for further proof) so exposure would be a no-brainer for her.But..."Learning From Falling" just falters. Let\'s begin with the lyrics. Lamya\'s lyrics sound like GOD-AWFUL poetry that Jewel and Alanis Morrisette would turn their nose up at. The lyrics are hilarious and I heavily doubt that that was the reaction she was going for. The lyrics sound like horrendous, pretenious, goofy poetry from a regular ol\' girl whose trying her hardest to be "bohemian".And...the production is overwrought and annoying. Sounding like a wedding band version of Phil Sector\'s string sections along with plodding hip hop beats. Add this to awful "prose" and sadly, you have the majority of "Learning From Falling"."Empires" is one of the worst songs released this year with it\'s awful production and it\'s unintentional "The Lion King" reject feel. The radio-friendly "Never Enough" turns out to be the only half-decent track and that\'s mediocre at best.The remake of Nick Drake\'s "Pink Moon" wouldn\'t be too bad if all that slick, bad production was toned down and her voice ( a weird hybrid of Macy Gray\'s and a disolute Side\'s) was mixed up front.Poor Lamya, she probably was just trying to be different and do her best but instead pulls off one of the year\'s best (unintentional) comedy records.Hopefully she\'ll take a cue from her album title and learn from this album\'s many mistakes since she more than fell on this debut.', 'overall': 2.0, 'summary': 'LEARN FROM NOT BUYING', 'unixReviewTime': 1032480000, 'reviewTime': '09 20, 2002'}

More "popular" albums raced up the charts for a few weeks only to disappear after a few weeks while Hybrid Theory rarely broke the top ten but sold for weeks and weeks.  Indeed, it still sells today.  Great way to fail.  But the question remained whether Linkin Park was just a flash in the pan.  It was great for its moment but was that moment over?I am not a fan of rap or hip-hop.  The first time I heard a rap song on the radio I thought it was amusing.  Then it followed with another rap song.  "You mean you\'re going to play another one?"  "You mean they have whole albums full of this stuff?"  To this day I remain under whelmed by rap/hip hop.  I don\'t hate it-I am just not impressed.  When others praise rappers for their inventiveness and clever rhymes I can only wonder what they are talking about.  Millions love this stuff so to a large degree it has to be me.So we come to Linkin Park and the mixing of heavy metal with elements of sampling and rapped lyrics.  As much as I enjoy it, I have to wonder if all this sampling and mixing all just adds up to an inessential dimension to the music.  Reading the liner notes it is clear Linkin Park feels sampling and mixing is crucial and inspirational.  Whatever, I have to admit that in several instances rapping the lyrics is a very powerful counterpoint to the metal onslaught in the music.Thematically, Meteora revolves around the need to escape from a toxic relationship.  It is not clear exactly who the singer is trying to leave.  It could be a girlfriend, parents or society in general.  A case could be made for any of these and perhaps it is that way by design.  The listener fills the blank in the recesses of his imagination.  We are told tales of drawing near to be pushed away, the deception the singer casts for the sake of that toxic other, the anger the singer has toward that venomous other that he has to deceive, and in some instances quilt that the fault lies in the singer rather than the lover he blames.  Lyrically, the album twists itself in obsession with aspects of this poisonous, killing union.  The singer seethes with rage, quilt, resentment and remorse.  The singer complains the toxic other so completely dominates their world yet is unaware of the singer\'s deepest feelings.  The mood alternates between release, hopelessness, entrapment and dejection.  Finally with the last song "Numb", the singer relates his inability to feel anything anymore.In some ways, when one just reads the lyrics you feel like you are reading the diary of some lost teenager who will one day take a firearm to high school and waste a few teachers and students before being cornered by the local SWAT team.  But that is a little over dramatic.  Such dreary obsessions have been rather common fair in teenage poetry for a long time.  Linkin Park\'s poetry is just several cuts above the standard musings of your average adolescent.  That is why millions soak it all up.  Adults may be baffled at why anyone would want to dwell of such dark subjects; but many of the youth understand immediately.Unlike some reviewers, I was immensely impressed with "Somewhere I Belong".  Again, like them, when "Somewhere I Belong" starts I wondered if it was going to go anywhere.  But then by the bridge the song turns absolutely ferocious.  It really packs it in in a mere 3 minutes and 34seconds.  Moreover, the whole album is like that.  So much happens that it is difficult to believe it is only 37 minutes long.I spite of all my reservations I found myself loving this album.  Some believe if a song gets radio play then it can\'t be all that good.  But I think "Somewhere I Belong", "Faint" and "Numb" are exceptional pieces of music which deserve the popularity, and admiration they have received.  Similarly, "Don\'t Stay", "Easier To Run" (my personal favorite), "Figure.09", "Breaking The Habit" and "From The Inside" all could be popular favorites in the future.On the down side, although it is getting significant radio play "Lying From You" just leaves me indifferent.  "Hit The Floor " is barely memorable.  "Foreword" and "Session" just waste time.This CD is both dark and wonderful.  I am still not sure all this preoccupation with sampling and mixing actually adds anything and I have no idea where Linkin Park will have to go to next.  But this CD is worth having.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'DREARY OBSESSIONS AND METAL BARRAGE', 'unixReviewTime': 1082592000, 'reviewTime': '04 22, 2004'}

Their self-titled 1999 debut was endearingly lo-fi, ramshackle blues-rock; 2000\'s De Stijl was a mini-masterpiece, presenting a slightly more polished blues-rock sound along with more pop hooks and modern-rock touches; and 2001\'s uneven White Blood Cells sounded more classic-rock than bluesy. That artistic step backwards nevertheless became their breakthrough album; now, if there\'s any justice in the (music) world, the excellent follow-up Elephant should put this Detroit duo over the top. (Like, how \'bout a Grammy nomination this time?)"Seven Nation Army" continues the Stripes\' tradition of easing the listener into their discs with an insanely catchy, roof-rattling rocker ("Jimmy the Exploder," "You\'re Pretty Good Looking For a Girl," "Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground"); and, good lord, is that a bass I hear? "Black Math" is gleefully sloppy blues-rock in the style of the self-titled disc (and how\'s this for a refrain: "Maybe I\'ll put my love on ice / And teach myself, maybe that\'ll be nice"?). "There\'s No Room for You Here" sounds like "Dead Leaves..." under the influence of Queen (instead of Zeppelin); and I don\'t know what it is about songwriter-guitarist-pianist-lead singer Jack White, but he can basically tell a girl to get out of his face and still sound quite charming. Tackling the Burt Bacharach-Hal David chestnut "I Just Don\'t Know What to Do With Myself," Jack\'s emotional singing and playing radiate hurt and anger. In "I Want to Be the Boy to Warm Your Mother\'s Heart," a tender piano ballad about a hapless guy trying to impress his girlfriend\'s mother, Jack conveys vulnerability as he seethes with mounting frustration (very similar in feel to "I\'m Finding it Harder to Be a Gentleman"). "You\'ve Got Her in Your Pocket" is a folkish, acoustic ballad in the mold of "We\'re Gonna Be Friends," albeit more sinister -- a love song that straddles the thin line between devotion and possessiveness. "The Hardest Button to Button" is a straight-ahead rocker with oddball family-drama lyrics and some hints of bass. "Hypnotize" -- like the single "Fell in Love With a Girl" -- is a too-short blast of punk energy and quirky love lyrics ("I want to hold your little hand, if I can be so bold!"). On "The Air Near My Fingers," a groovy blues-rocker that would\'ve sounded at home on De Stijl, Jack sings about being a "mama\'s boy." "Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine" is giddy garage-rock, with an awesome chorus that incorporates the word "Acetaminophen"!When I first listened to this disc, it sounded to me like a greatest-hits collection consisting entirely of previously unreleased songs; but you can\'t blame the Stripes for sticking with a winning formula (like the whole red-and-white thing -- I don\'t care what anybody says, I think it\'s classy). However, Jack and Meg White -- by all accounts, a divorced couple who have marketed themselves as ersatz siblings, a la The Ramones -- aren\'t above throwing the listener a few curveballs. "Ball and Biscuit" starts out as a standard blues-rocker, but turns into a powerhouse seven-minute jam thanks to Jack\'s squealing guitar solos. "Little Acorns" reminds me of They Might Be Giants, of all people (speaking of adorable, eccentric alternative-rock duos...); with Mort Crim\'s spoken intro leading into a bluesy, funky jam, and whimsical lyrics ("Be like the squirrel, girl ... Give it a whirl, girl") offsetting the propulsive rhythms, it sounds like a hybrid of "John Lee Supertaster" and "Snail Shell." Meg, the duo\'s versatile drummer, finally gets to sing lead on the seductive "In the Cold Cold Night;" though she lacks her "brother\'s" distinctiveness, her voice is still a sweet surprise. The cute, super-catchy, countryish closer "Well, it\'s True That We Love One Another" consists of a three-way conversation between Jack, British chanteuse Holly Golightly (playing the object of Jack\'s affection with a friendly twang), and Meg (who\'s a deadpan delight, dispensing romantic advice).Elephant ranks with De Stijl as the Stripes\' best album thus far; I suppose that with fewer tracks (14 and 13, respectively), there\'s less room for filler. As with the first three White Stripes discs, the lyrics are sometimes goofy, often heartfelt, and always evasive -- Jack shows growth as a storyteller and yet maintains an air of mystery about him -- without ever resorting to profanity (how refreshing in today\'s Parental Advisory-stickered modern-rock realm!). Ultimately, this album feels like a culmination of everything Jack and Meg have worked for on previous records; they\'re still paying proper respect to their early blues influences, but also pushing themselves forward. I, for one, can\'t wait to see where they go next.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Another small masterpiece for the Stripes!', 'unixReviewTime': 1049414400, 'reviewTime': '04 4, 2003'}

The downside, of course, is that this one is merely good.First, let me lay my cards on the table and say that I am one of those people who believes in what another reviewer calls &quot;the holy trinity&quot;: Tigermilk, If You're Feeling Sinister, and Arab Strap.  Those albums, to me, are classics that I will never put down.  Unlike some B&amp;S fans, I actually find their music better accompaniment for a sunny day than a rainy one.As far as this album goes, it is a radical departure in sound from their previous releases.  It is very pop-sounding and for the first time shows that B&amp;S have enlisted the services of a professional producer.  However, the lyrical content of the songs remains the same: witty, wry, and wistful by turns and terribly, terribly clever.  Those longing for a taste of the old B&amp;S will best be served by &quot;Lord Anthony&quot; (which is the one song I ripped to my iPod before selling this album), while new converts may find each track exciting.I really, really tried to give this album a chance.  I played it for a week while driving, grocery shopping, commuting, and reading.  At the end of it all, I was no more endeared to the album than when I started and the songs had started to sound even more similar.  I am not wishing that Belle &amp; Sebastian keep the same sound forever, but I think this is a stepping stone to finding their new sound somewhere down the line.  The most apt comparison that I can think of is to R.E.M.  They made several classic albums and developed a loyal fan base, but I don't know anyone who thought &quot;Monster&quot; was a good album.  It was merely a transitional album while they tried out new sounds.  After a couple of missteps, they made &quot;Reveal&quot;, which ranks among their best.  I think B&amp;S will evolve into something even more amazing in the future, but &quot;Waitress&quot; strikes me as an awkward growing pain.Why the three stars?

Her music is unlike any other. It has some musical structure from Kate Bush's aura but also stems into a distinctive brand of popular music. She came out in 1992 with her debut album and managed to grow the loyalist of fans. As the Lilith Fair bonanza took affect in the mid and late 90's, her appeal was much more alluring. However, charts and radio were never really her friends but she managed to conjure up enough exceptional ditties to keep the best critics at her side and the most serious of devotees following her every release.Her poetic songs and way with the oblivion allowed her career to flourish and now she is celebrating her impressive catalogue with an anthology of some of her great songs without making it a bland greatest hits album. &quot;Tales Of A Librarian: A Tori Amos Collection&quot; visits many of her victories.Amos never sounds monotone nor does she stick to a song template. Her songs are very gawkily structured yet at the same time beautiful to the ear. An Example would be &quot;Way Down,&quot; and song that starts out as a delightfully heartrending song and ends up with a gospel feel.The leisurely chanteuse opens the album with what is arguably her best track &quot;Precious Things&quot; This song dates back to her first album and is packed with hostile lyrics and a carefully crafted melody.Her lyrics are never compromising and always twist and turn to amuse, whether she is curiously vague on &quot;Mr. Zebra&quot; or tackling the horrific incident of her rape on &quot;Me And A Gun.&quot;Nevertheless, dance-oriented people will not be disappointed with the inclusion of Amos's surprise hit remix of &quot;Professional Widow.&quot;But other than that this collection settles for the slower number like the insightful &quot;Silent All These Years&quot; and the warm &quot;Winter.&quot;The biopic of &quot;Jackie's Strength,&quot; which is an ode to Jackie Onasis's life is a superior track much like &quot;God.&quot;This release chronicle's this icon's masterpieces and will take you on a trip through memory lane if you are a fan.

A fast-moving collection that goes just north of 40 minutes, it glides by in what feels like seconds.Many consider Morissette to be at the end of her rope, with little left to write about now that she is in love with Canadian actor Ryan Reynolds, while others still dismiss her as &quot;angry,&quot; maintaining that she needs to calm down. Both groups should listen to the set's lead single, &quot;Everything,&quot; an infectious track where Morissette articulates the eureka moment of realizing her &quot;every part&quot; has been accepted with open arms by the love of her life. Still, it's the least catchy song on the album. The video for the single is one of the many bonus features of the disc.Morissette has not completely finished complaining, however, and on &quot;Eight Easy Steps&quot; this is more than apparent: She literally tears herself to shreds, owning up to a multitude of personal flaws. The rip-roaring track will most likely be the second single, while the glorious &quot;Out Is Through&quot; will be released in Europe.Meanwhile, in the lovable, sitar-tinged &quot;Knees of My Bees,&quot; she likens Reynolds to &quot;a vision who lives by the signals of stomach and intuition&quot; as his guide, &quot;with tendencies for conversations that raise bars&quot; who &quot;comes to nooks and crannies as balm for all scars.&quot; In a nutshell, she is as happy as a clam with her new guy.The disc's second half contains the two most career-defining songs she has ever written. &quot;Not All Me,&quot; with its soaring chorus and profound beauty, is so moving it is unimaginable such raw power could be contained on a thin compact disc:&quot;I am the perfect target screen for your blindly fueled rage/I bear the brunt of your long buried pain/I don't mind helping you out but I want you to remember my name/It's not all me/It's not all my fault/I may remind you/But I won't take it all on/I'll only take some of it.&quot;&quot;This Grudge&quot; follows, which finds Morissette finally letting go of the issue that has inspired past hits such as &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; and &quot;Hands Clean.&quot; As eye opening as it is personal, one must give her credit for opening up to her listeners:&quot;Here I sit, much determined ever ill-equipped to draw this curtain/How this has entertained, validated and has served me greatly ever the victim/But who's done whining now?/Who's ready to put down?/This load I've carried longer than I had cared to remember/I want to be big and let go of this grudge that's grown old.&quot;Morissette has reached new heights with &quot;So-Called Chaos,&quot; a testament to her unceasing talent and creativity.

"Take You On A Cruise" comes shortly there after with a smooth guitar line and actually clever laid back lyrics with lines like "Time is like a broken watch and make money like Fred Astaire". "Slow Hands" which is possibly the best song on the record is the essential rock song of the album and leaves a trail of oily rock behind that lingers in your head for weeks(Trust me it wont get out of your head!!!)."Not Even Jail" is not even close to being a very good song, it starts out very oddly and dis harmonized and leads into weak singing and simple bass that i must admit is terrible. "Public Pervert" follows and really gets you moving with funk/blues influenced guitar riffs and excellingly simple drums that actually are more needed than fancy kicks or rolls. "C\'mere" is like a cross between of "Slow Hands" and "No Exit" with essentially the same music as "No Exit" but the rock feel of "Slow Hands".

Paul Wall\'s The Peoples Champ is another release representing Houston, Texas elements that make this the new hot spot by the way they style as said on "They Don\'t Know" featuring Mike Jones.  This album begins with the production and feature of DJ Paul & Juicy J for that classic Hypnotize Minds sound.  "Ridin\' Dirty" featuring Trey Songz has a southern gospel feel as Paul describes the hustle.  Speeding up and changing from that Texas sound with the uncompromising horn on "State To State" featuring Freeway.  What\'s better than to have a collaboration of The People\'s Champ with the King on "So Many Diamonds" featuring T.I. as the Paul Wall flowed upbeat to the slow grinding song.  He shows off his macking and verbal skills on "Smooth Operator".  The standout production by Salih Williams and overall highlight of this LP, "Sittin\' Sidewayz" featuring Big Pokey is especially for showing off in the parking lot.  Deserving acknowledgement for overall subject matter, and story on "Internet Going Nutz", but is just filler for the album.  "Trill" featuring BG & Bun B with it\'s meaning of being true and real goes for that hardcore sound for this triple threat.  Another southern feel on "Sippin\' Tha Barre" gives all the spotlight of Paul\'s flow.  The production of Kanye West on "Drive Slow" featuring Kanye West & GLC over a jazzy track was much needed for the well rounded feel for a successful album.  "March N\' Step" featuring Grit Boys & Lil\' Wayne was another filler but worth hearing Wayne\'s verse as he took the spotlight.  Swisha House members stood strong with the trio\'s introduction to a major market on "Got Plex" featuring Archie Lee & Cootabang.  As most of the subjects "Big Ballin\'" isn\'t any different as it doesn\'t standout, but a good addition to the album\'s complete package.  The album concludes with substance on "Just Paul Wall" as he tackles his past issues, trials and tribulations.  There\'s only a few that have done it and Paul Wall, for being white in an African American\'s new version of blues, is good for what it is but do not expect the verbal abilities as Eminem.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Whut It Dew?

I liked it and I couldn\'t believe it. Then a few months later I was at Amoeba Records (Heaven on Earth) and bought a bunch of CDs including many discounted CDs, when I got to the counter they informed me that I got another discounted CD for free because of the amount of items I had, not wanting to wade through the gazillion CDs again, I remembered that I had seen the OK Go album so I ran back and got it. I was more than pleasantly surprised to find out that that debut CD was the best album I had heard in a long time. Completely blown out of the water. The single was just as good as I remembered, but that was only the beginning. Someday I\'ll review that one but for today, we\'re here at their second album and because I loved the first one so much I did run out and buy Oh No the minute it came out.But I must admit I wasn\'t as interested as I had been. The same feelings are still there for the most part - a power produced bunch of punky pop talking about girls, bad girls, good girls, the girls who done wrong, the girls who were done wrong and the like but it didn\'t strike me and pin me up against a wall like the first one.But then they did that clever video for "Here It Goes Again" and I brought this CD out of the dust bin and what do you know, now I really like it and can\'t stop listening to it. Opening with "Invincible" - the first single, and moving on one pop punky gem after another, the album has suddenly grown on me. Now I\'m not saying this is classic by any means, and to me it\'s not even as good as the first one, but for pure power pop this is great to hear with the wind blowing through your hair and your fist in the air.', 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'Not As Good But A OK Go', 'unixReviewTime': 1214438400, 'reviewTime': '06 26, 2008'}

Featured on hits such as "Big Pimpin" (Jay-Z), "Stick Em Up" (Ludacris), and manh others. After Pimp C went to jail, everyone anticpated a solo album from Bun B after being featured on songs by Webbie, Paul Wall, Young Jeezy and Slim Thug. WIth his album "Trill", he lives up to his expectations and the hype.The album kicks off with the presidental-toned "The Inauguration" where Bun B claims he\'s the chief of the rap game and that he\'s coming. I wasn\'t really feeling the next track "Bun", maybe because it felt out of place or it hasn\'t grown on me yet. "Get Throwed" is a slowed down, laid back track featuring Jay-Z, Pimp C, Jeezy and up and comer, Z-Ro. Bun B\'s first single, "Draped Up" is defintely one of the best songs on the album. The beat (along with the bass) is just amazing and it gives it that crunk flavor. "I\'m Fresh" is the next with the super producer Mannie Fresh who is also featured in the song "What I Represent (UGK)", which is a really good song with a nice beat. Ludacris is next featured on the soon-to-be anthem "Trill Recognize Trill". The beat will have many people getting up and getting wild as Luda and Bun exchange verses. "Pushin" is an inspirational street song with Jeezy and Scarface. The sample is used very wisely and I like all three rappers in the song, even Jeezy. "I\'m Ballin" could be another single if Bun B wants to attract the mainstream audience. The best song in my opinion on the album is "The Story". Mainly because Bun B spends 6 mintues going through even that got him to where he is now including label disputes, friendship with Pimp C and staying to his word."Hold U Down" is another laid back track which features Baby, Jeezy and the R&B; lyrics of Trey Songz. Definitely a good track if you tryna lay back with a certain someone. "I\'m A G" is a track that really grew on me and is becoming one of my favorite hits on the album. Bun joins with TI to lace up a good track. The next 3 tracks feature the likes of Ying Yang Twinz, Middle Fingerz, Too Short and Juvenile. For the most part those track are skippable. The "Draped Up Remix" features a lot of the Houston rappers with Paul Wall, Mike Jones, Chamillionaire, Slim Thug, Lil Flip and more. "Late Night Creepin" ends the album on a creepy note with Skinhead Rob and Travis Barker.This was the only Southern album that I really anticipateed this year and I\'m glad that Bun B finally got to release this because this is really an exceptional album.

It was hard for me to adjust to a Cash Money release lacking Fresh's infectious beats, but once I took this for what it is(which is a Wayne release; not Mannie), I actually began to appreciate it more than its predecessor.I won't lie, and say I followed Wayne before Tha Carter. The only time Cash Money ever appealed to me was through the Big Tymers' I Got Work, as well as Juvenile's 400 Degreez. I honestly did think Cash Money was a dead empire before 2003, when Juvenile's Juve The Great brought some mainstream spotlight back onto the label. Juvenile didn't have an extended stay on the label, but it didn't matter; later that same year, Wayne picked up the ball, and ran with it, releasing Tha Carter. Tha Carter was built on Mannie's beats and Wayne's newfound flow; Mannie laying the foundation to this complex, and Wayne building from there with his rhymes.I think all of us were worried when we found out Mannie severed ties with Cash Money, because Tha Carter 2 seemingly needed Mannie's beats to once again cememt that foundation. However, Wayne didn't allow his house to crumble; instead, he brought in a cast of underground, east coast producers, and created Tha Carter 2; arguably the greatest release to ever come out of Cash Money Records.The sound is nothing like previous Cash Money albums; and that's why it succeeds. With production handled by a handful of cats, they provide the perfect musical backdrop for Wayne's unique flow. While Tha Carter was a great release, Wayne sounded a bit too comfortable flowing over the beats Mannie produced; changing his enviorment like he did on this release brought out the best in Wayne. On The Carter, Mannie's production sometimes overshadowed Wayne's lyrics; on Tha Carter 2, they perfectly compliment them.This is a great album from beginning to end; saying this will become a classic within the coming years would not be an overstatement at all. As it stands, it IS a Cash Money classic, and one of the best modern commercial hip-hop releases you're going to find from any region. Wayne may not be the deepest of individuals, but he has a supreme way with wordplay, an infectious flow, and an ear for truly hot beats; make sure to pick up this release if you're a hip-hop head.", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Re-evaluating this release.', 'unixReviewTime': 1162166400, 'reviewTime': '10 30, 2006'}

Youre only performing for maybe 90 seconds to 2 minutes, the talent youre up against is usually very amateur, and youre singing someone else\'s material.  Its a much tougher task to shine on a 50 minute cd.  Chris has potential.  He is confident on the stage and his voice can take a beating.But...he needs help in the songwriting department.

By the end of the cd, and i hate to say this, I was nearly sick of Chris\'s voice.  The fault is not with his voice...the fault is with the weak songs.  Chris is best suited for turning up the volume, laying back, and having fun (in other words rocking HARD).  He did this on a couple of tracks, but thats not enough.

The rock radio stations where I live (and I live in Chris\'s home state for crying out loud) arent even playing it.

My biases against them wouldn\'t let me check out "Straight Outta Cashville", Young Buck\'s first solo album. I usually check any artist coming straight outta Tennessee, because it\'s my state. I wasn\'t feeling "Let Me In", or whatever it was called, and "Shorty Wanna Ride With Me" either. Then this year, "Buck The World" drops with little to no hype, and honestly, I was curious as to how it sounded. "I Know You Want Me" got no attention from me, but the rest of the album came as a pleasant surprise.The opener, "Push Em Back", will get you hyped up in no time. "Say It To My Face" features Bun B and Eightball & MJG. It\'s a tight track with excellent production and good verses from all guests. "I Ain\'t F******* Wit U" is a cut dedicated to snitches. Snoop Dogg and Trick Daddy come in to drop their verses, and the smooth singing by _____ provides for a good chorus. "Buck The World" is definitely one of my favorites. Lyfe Jennings gives the listener a powerful chorus, and Buck gets a little introspective but still keeps it gangsta. "Slow Ya Role" speaks on growing up too fast. On paper, a Chester Bennington (Linkin Park) and Young Buck collaboration would sound bad, but Bennington lays down a nice backdrop to Buck\'s chorus and lends a nice bridge. It\'s another stand-out. "Haters" features Kokane and is another track where Buck goes hard at whoever his adversary\'s may be. The beat and chorus are both excellent. "Hold On" featuring 50 cent is catchy as hell. "Puff Puff Pass" is self-explanatory. I usually don\'t like songs commemorating reefer, but this has such a good vibe and sound to it that you can\'t help but listen. "4 Kings" has been out for awhile but it still bumps. "Lose My Mind" is an excellent way to close out the album (if you forget the bonus track). Buck yells out his feelings over the beat. This is the perfect song to listen to when you\'ve had it with the world.There are plenty of good cuts here, but there are also some throwaways. "Buss Yo Head" may energize some people, but it sounds rehashed. It\'s simple and is used strictly for filler. I may get hated for this, but I also do not like "Get Buck". In some way it comes off as boring to me. However, I do think it was a good choice for a single. "Pocket Full Of Paper" is ruined by Young Jeezy. "U Ain\'t Goin Nowhere" featuring LaToiya Williams is lackluster. "Money Good" is also pretty self explanatory. Yes, we know your money is good. "I Know U Want Me" is a supbar single that lacks substance. It\'s no wonder it didn\'t get much play (atleast not here in Kentucky).Those mentioned above don\'t make the cut, but it\'s still a solid album. I\'m glad I decided to check it out, for it is atleast worth a download. If you remotely like G-Unit or southern Hip-Hop, you\'ll appreciate the disc entirely. If you\'re not really into those that much, you\'ll still appreciate hits like "Slow Ya Role", "Buck the World", "Lose My Mind", and "Haters".

I didn\'t stop liking him; I just didn\'t listen to him in the five years between that album and the release of this one. When Relapse was released, I remembered the love I once had for Eminem, downloaded the album, and threw it on my iPod. Listening to snippets of each song, I was bothered by his heavy use of accents, attributed that to just growing out of him musically, and deleted it. OnceRecoverycame out, I found my love for Eminem renewed and decided to give Relapse another shot. Relapse was Eminem\'s first album in five years and it was a successful comeback album, winning him Grammy awards and selling millions of copies. Eminem has since expressed his disapproval of the album and when an album is as successful as Relapse and an artist still expresses their unhappiness with it, something must be wrong. Sitting down to listen to Relapse, I expected something mediocre and found myself surprised.The album has 20 tracks, 15 of which are actual songs, and 12 of those 15 have Eminem rapping in some type of accent. Despite the appearance of actor Dominic West and the way the skits tie together to create the feel of a concept album, I have nothing much to say about the skits...They\'re amusing at times, but I delete them off my iPod once I listen to the album. With that said, I\'ll discuss the songs.While his lyrics do touch on the subject of his mother, his drug addiction, and his recovery much of the lyrics on Relapse detail murder fantasies and feature an extensive amount of celebrity name-dropping. It\'s Eminem\'s darkest album lyrically and a complete departure from the three studio releases that preceded it. The more I\'ve listened to Relapse, the more it reminds me ofThe Slim Shady LP. Both are completely different albums, but Relapse resembles that album more closely than any other Eminem album and is likely the closest thing Eminem has done or ever will do to that record.Listening to the album several times, there\'s not a single weak track on the album although at first I thought so. I initially couldn\'t stand the track "3 a.m.," but I now find it delightfully macabre. "My Mom" is very reminiscent of TSSLP, with lyrics that alternate between lame ("Now I\'m on what I\'m on cause I\'m my mom") and clever ("...Then I fall in bed/With a bottle of meds/And a Heath Ledger bobblehead"). "Insane" is a song that is pure shock value, with a really cool beat that sounds like a remixed horror film score. "Bagpipes from Baghdad" is a witty, catchy track that began the Eminem-Maria Carey feud and the song itself exists somewhere between Encore and The Eminem Show."Hello" and "Same Song & Dance" (the latter being a murder fantasy about Lindsay Lohan and Britney Spears) are good tracks, but not incredibly memorable. "We Made You" was one of the singles and it\'s a fun, fast, witty, and infectious track with a chorus by Charmagne Tripp that works remarkably well. It\'s also one of the only songs that appear to really work with the accent."Medicine Ball" is a blatantly offensive; not-to-be-taken seriously rap that actually has Eminem rapping as Christopher Reeve at one point. Next we have another murder fantasy ("Stay Wide Awake" which has a very memorable chorus), two "fun" songs featuring guests ("Old Times Sake" with Dr. Dre and "Crack a Bottle" with Dre and 50 Cent), a very catchy "fun" song ("Must Be the Ganja"), two of Eminem\'s most personal tracks ("D&eacute;j&agrave; vu" and "Beautiful"), and arguably the best track on the album ("Underground")."D&eacute;j&agrave; vu" is the only track that has Eminem rapping about his drug addiction and "Beautiful" is the most personal track on the album; both, coincidentally, feature Eminem rapping in his real voice. But if you\'re looking for the deeply personal Eminem we all know and love, this is not the album for you. If all of Eminem\'s previous albums were non-fictional, this is his first fictional record. While murder fantasies are prevalent throughout the record, tracks like "Must Be the Ganja" and "Crack a Bottle" do bring a little bit of light to the dark record Eminem has created here.As I said, there\'s not a weak track here...But my favorite tracks are D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, Beautiful, and Underground, all of which have him rapping in his normal voice. While I do prefer Eminem\'s style of rapping on Recovery, this album is actually a solid, eclectic effort from the rapper. His extensive use of accents extensively throughout the album may bother some, but it\'s a style that suits the morbid, dark subject matter much better than his normal voice would have. I can\'t say where this album ranks in the Eminem cannon, but it\'s a great album that only got better the more I listened to it. For me, this album solidifies Eminem\'s staying power in the rap genre and shows a rapper willing to experiment with his art. Who else could make an album with several murder fantasies that also happens to be witty and fun at the same time?GRADE: A-', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'A Difficult Album That Improves with Each Listen', 'unixReviewTime': 1287532800, 'reviewTime': '10 20, 2010'}

This was a demanding role,especially from a relative newcomer. And Hudson not only made an enormous impression vocally in the film,but pulled off her role from an acting perspective so convincingly that she is one of the few personalities of that era who almost upstaged Beyonce\',even though it was by no means intentional. It was clear that Hudson was going to have a major impact as a recording artist. The soul/R&B; world she was entering into was filled with negligible vocal talents backed up by fair to middling music,to be kind. Especially when it came to female performers. They often were more in the position of being recording super models,more concerned with fashion and makeup than musical talent. So hooking up with Clive Davis at Arista,Hudson basically came at the music world from the opposite end of the spectrum."Spotlight" begins the album with one of it\'s very best numbers,a vibrant late 70\'s/early 80\'s post disco dance/funk number that introduces Hudson\'s booming soul belt of a voice with a melodically strong number very much worthy of the vocalists abilities. The slower material such as "If This Isn\'t Love","Giving Myself","You Pulled Me Through","Invisible" and the dynamic "Can\'t Stop The Rain" get the full on Aretha treatment where her vocal relationship with the music and melody is so close knit it seems a sure fire chance she wrote the songs herself. For a track featuring a cliched guest rapper the beat boxing and harmonically rich "Pocketbook",with Ludacris not only has a spicy sense of humor about it but is extremely funky musically and his rap goes well with the song. Cannot say the same for "What\'s Wrong (Go Away) with T-Pain,which is too defined by it\'s cliches of autotune and too much attention focused on the guest where..well one might feel they want to take the song title literally.Hudson brings out the heavy southern soul flavor on both "I\'m His Only Woman",a sassy two timer anthem with her and Fantasia as "the two lovers" and "And I\'m Telling You I\'m Not Going". Musically and vocally,this challenging gospel style soul number is the highlight of the entire album with Hudson and the band bursting out of the music with so much emotional expression that Hudson seems like she will hold her final note in the song for an eternity. The closer is the more obvious gospel of "Jesus Promised Me A Home Over There",done more subtly. In the end,this is not a perfect album. But few of the best debuts are. It often isn\'t fair to the rest of an artists career if it is. But the majority of the album is extremely strong,and musically varied just to the right point where a vocalist of Hudson\'s caliber is able to discover what levels of soul and grooves she\'s best at dealing with. In the end,I\'m convinced that with the release of this debut that she made those decisions very quickly and ably.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'The Debut Of An Important New Talent', 'unixReviewTime': 1349481600, 'reviewTime': '10 6, 2012'}

Not to say that there aren\'t some good songs and ideas here, but the delivery sounds forced and tortured, especially during the first half of the album.The first few seconds into the lead track "Oh My God," and I was thinking, Oh my God, who let this person think she could sing, let alone make an album. To say she was out of key throughout much of the song is an understatement. John Lydon sounds Mel Torme-smooth by comparison. Maria also sounds like she barely has one octave in her vocal range (perhaps she has black lung).The horror of her signing comes full circle by the time you get to "Stella." There is a fine line between a sexy, raspy vocal, and the sound of a kitten being eaten alive by sharks, and Maria painfully treads on the wrong side of that line. I still can\'t believe they cut the music out toward the end, just to let her shriek "Stella.. Stell.. AAAAAAAhhhh" for a few measures.The second half of the album is better, and the production seems to help polish the vocals. "Keep Me Warm" is a nice ballad where her raspy vocals work to her advantage and don\'t sound so forced. "Forgive Me" and "Queen of the World" are also really great upbeat tracks that sound 100 miles away from the first half of the album. Then, Ida Maria closes the album with a brilliantly minimalistic acoustic ballad that makes you double check the CD case wondering if you somehow through in Mazzy Star by mistake.The first half of the album leaves you scratching your head while the second half redeems itself somehow.

But his CD reveals more talent and appeal than I gave him credit for.  On the show, I didn\'t regard Kris as being "serious" enough.  But on this album, he sings about serious subject matter, mostly relationship problems, and his voice reveals both intimacy and strength that I didn\'t notice on Idol.  The lyrics are very clearly sung, and despite the production, his vocals, when they are not multi-tracked, almost seem "live".  You can hear Kris begging for understanding of his human flaws, and expressing other basic feelings - confusion, need, determination, the joy of youth.  Some of the music is slightly country-tinged, but mostly it sounds like mainstream pop-rock.  Although many tracks are formulaic, this is to be expected on the first album from an Idol contestant.  It\'s up to the artist to breathe life into them, and Kris does this.  The material is mostly sincere, not much attitude or irony (although he does strike a hard-rock pose in "Can\'t Stay Away"); but then, he\'s a sincere guy.  My favorite tracks are "Written All Over My Face", with its demanding "talky" vocal and some glam-rock guitar; "Is It Over", which has a "bluesy" feel, both vocally and instrumentally; "Alright With Me", a happy, carefree acoustic number; "I Need To Know", a slow, quiet piano ballad with touching lyrics and heartfelt delivery; and "Heartless", another demanding vocal beautifully executed.

This would have been bad enough in any other/normal situation, but both Stone and the album had basically been held hostage for almost a year due to record company politics. One, two, three strikes....you\'re out!!And that\'s too bad, because COLOUR ME FREE! is one of Joss Stone\'s strongest efforts to date. Yes, I\'m still waiting for her to stretch into other areas (rock, pop, country), and she still needs to learn how to rein things in at times, but there\'s enough growth here to say that she\'s once again moving forward, a statement that couldn\'t be made after 2007\'s disappointing INTRODUCING JOSS STONE.Things open with the slammin\', stingin\' "Free Me." Be it a relationship or a record contract, it\'s clear that A) Stone is no longer a little girl, and B) she\'s not to be messed with. Anchored by a wailing lead vocal, a percolating arrangement and defiant lyrics ("Something that you don\'t see every day/A little girl who found her way/Through a world that\'s designed to break/All of your dreams"), this is the perfect way to get things started."Could Have Been You" is my favorite track on the disc. With it\'s twinkling piano and shimmering backing vocals, there\'s an amazingly cool retro groove going on, but you can also picture any number of other contemporary acts covering the song. Wisely, Stone keeps it low key and understated for most of the cut (proving you don\'t always have to hit the big note!), which allows her to just SING. In a just world, "Could Have Been You" would well be on it\'s way ~ or already achieved! ~ major hit status! Sheer perfection."Parallel Lines" has a nice 70\'s soul feel to it, sort of a lost Stevie Wonder or Roberta Flack track. Stone\'s vocal is sultry, yet authoritative, while the arrangement is brilliantly bolstered by Jeff Beck\'s sizzling guitar and Sheila E.\'s popping percussion. Another very nice piece of work!There\'s a slow burn to "Lady" that get\'s under your skin and stays there. Stone\'s vocal swoops and soars, and when she sings "See, it\'s o.k. to be sassy/But I\'ll never be trashy/It\'s o.k. to be nasty/But you gotta keep your classy now" you know EXACTLY what she\'s talking about!"4 And 20" is one of the biggest leaps forward on COLOUR ME FREE!...there\'s a classic jazz appreciation going on here, and Stone pulls it off without a hitch. Her vocal is spot-on, while the instrumentation is relaxed and easy-going (Special mention has to be made of Hollie Farris\' sinewy, seductive trumpet playing)."Big Ol\' Game" is my other favorite cut on the album. Buoyed by a KILLER bass line, it just has an amazing groove to it. Part rock, part soul, all sexy attitude, this is the type of song that has you moving to it from start to finish, no matter how many times you\'ve heard it. Toss in a captivating lead vocal and hot horns and you have another massive "Should\'ve-Been-A-Hit." LOVE it!!Things take a bit of a 180 with "Govermentalist." While everything flow naturally with most of the previous cuts, it all seems a tad bit forced here. It\'s as if Stone is TRYING to "say" something...vs. just saying it! Nas\' rap also seems calculated and tacked on, resulting in a cut that, while not bad, just doesn\'t measure up to the rest of the disc.Things get back on track with the energetic "Incredible." With an arrangement that is just smoking, this is a dance hit just waiting to happen. My only complaint? Stone\'s lead vocal. Instead of ALWAYS taking things to 11 ~ we know you can belt it out, Joss! ~ I would have liked to have seen her modulate things a bit more, offering up a bit more of give and take, push and pull, belting...and holding back. Still, another great track!The disc takes a slight (but noticable) dip at this point. "You Got The Love" is an inspirational number that is completely lacking in true inspiration. The lead vocal is by the numbers and rote, while the arrangement is standard and unoriginal; this is soul faith 101. Four albums into her career, Stone shouldn\'t be stumbling backwards like this."I Believe It To My Soul" is only slightly better. Yes, the horn arrangement just stuns on this Ray Charles classic, but Stone\'s vocal performance is the aural equivalent of a kareoke showdown. Totally over the top, it\'s all image over content, attitude over substance. A prime example that, at just 23, Stone still has a lot to learn.Far better is the disc\'s purest piece of pop, the lovely duet "Stalemate." Romantic and emotional, this mid-tempo ballad just pulsates with pained heat. The cut\'s only problem? It almost sounds more like a Jamie Hartman track with a guest vocal from Joss Stone, instead of the other way around. You should NEVER be perceived as the support act on your own disc! However, even with this minor flaw, this is still one of my favorite tracks."Girlfriend On Demand" is the perfect album closer...a lush ballad, it sports a heartfelt, sincere lead vocal, crisp, clean, uncluttered instrumentation and gut-wrenching lyrics ("You whisper that you love me/Ooh, but you won\'t say it out loud/You act like you\'re ashamed to be with me/I want a man who\'s proud"). One of Stone\'s best moments to date.The import version of COLOUR ME FREE! has the added bonus track "Mr. Wankerman", which, to be honest, is nothing more than a fourteen minute jam that goes on for eleven minutes longer than it should. Once again, we\'re treated (?) to more attitude than substance, resulting in a cut that just falls flat, coming across as self-indulgent and shallow.And that\'s too bad, because both Joss Stone and COLOUR ME FREE! are so much more. Yet as strong as COLOUR...is ~ and it just might be her strongest release yet! ~ there\'s a lot Stone can still learn. What she needs to do now is broaden her palette and paint with some new COLOURS. C\'mon, Jossy, I know you can do it!

I don\'t like how the opening track didn\'t blow me away. And I haven\'t liked all the hype leading up to Angles, the fourth album from The Strokes. Why mention these things? Because these are all things that The Strokes have always done right, even on their many side project releases. The titles and covers and opening tracks are always so spot on that I can\'t help but root for the project - whatever it may be. Plain and simple, Strokes leader and frontman, Julian Casablancas (who released a surprisingly great solo record in 2009) is a tastemaker. He brought the 70s garage aesthetic back to the mainstream with The Strokes\' 2001 classic Is This It and has here and there influenced fashion, rock celebrity and music ever since. With Angles I get none of that, which, for a longtime devout fan, is alarming.But who cares. People don\'t look at album covers or memorize titles or even listen to full track lists anymore. They pick out their two or four or six favorite songs and toss them onto the ocean of music that is their backup drive. Not me. And maybe I\'m dreaming, but I like to think that I\'m not the only listener who thinks the art of album making is still going strong. Anyhow, those mostly aesthetic hurdles aside, Angles does feel more like front-to-back record than most, even if it doesn\'t quite accomplish the return to glory vibe we were promised. Instead, we get a somewhat schizophrenic sounding set that features a handful of songs that could very easily do well as radio singles, including "Under Cover of Darkness" and "Taken For a Fool."Stories surrounding the recording of the album tell us that Casablancas, tired of being the band\'s leader, ended up leaving the sessions and communicating with his fellow bandmates via e-mail and text while they recorded their parts without him. He\'d record his vocals at a separate studio and, as he puts it, force the others to figure out things for themselves. Me? I hate that. Sure, Albert Hammond, Jr. had that one great solo album, but, for the most part, I like this band for one reason: Julian Casablancas. What results from this method is a record that feels like a mix of early Strokes and, say, MGMT. The bulk of the record doesn\'t feature the production jump that First Impressions of Earth had, but it doesn\'t offer the lean/raw sound of the band\'s first two - and by-far best - records.As good as about half this record is, Angles as a whole often feels too produced, too modern to really offer the Strokes appeal we all look for when we buy a Strokes disc. Songs like "Metabolism" and "You\'re So Right" are downright annoying while "Two Kinds of Happiness," though a decent pop song, feels like a good song that was run through some sort of 1980s filter. "Games," one of the record\'s big winners, sounds like it belongs on Casablancas\' recent solo record while "Under Cover," "Taken For a Fool" and "Gratisfaction" all sound like early-era Strokes songs, the later a jukebox blaster of epic proportions.In the end, only five of the album\'s cuts are completely solid, two need to disappear forever and the other three are either half-great or growers. And so we end up with a decent enough record that is maybe better than First Impressions (which featured an amazing first half) but not nearly as memorable as those first two Strokes releases. The truly great moments make the Angles worth buying; the growers make it worth talking about; the big stinkers make Angles an album to worry about. All that said, the fourth Strokes band album is certainly worth getting to know, even if it will likely continue the post-Is This It heartbreak longtime believers have been suffering though. Face it, friends, The Strokes will never again be that perfect garage pop band that so many of us fell so hard for back in 2001.Check out more of my reviews at [...]', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Half Amazing!!!

The trio harmonizes in tight, veering lines that recall the Andrews Sisters, and trade opportunities to write and sing lead. Signed to Columbia, the production has Nashville production quality, but the backings include steel and acoustic guitar, and only occasionally venture into the contemporary country mold. The trio sings gritty songs of outlaw women leading rough lives of marital discord, family dysfunction, economic drought and bad habits. The latter hits a peak with the excess libations of the superbly not-ready-for-modern-country-radio "Takin\' Pills." Lambert can\'t help but shine, but she\'s clearly settled into the group vibe, sharing the spotlight with her friends and making this a balanced showcase of all three Annies\' pistol-sharp singing and songwriting talent.

Gotye has been at it for a number of years as part of the Aussie band the Basics but also issuing several solo albums: in 2003 there was "Boardface" and in 2006 "Like Drawing Blood" (remixed the next year as "Mixed Blood"). Now after a 5 year absence comes the new album. If you\'re not familiar with the sound of Gotye, the best comparison I can think of would be a strangely appealing mix of Beck, George Michael and Seal, if you can believe that."Making Mirrors" (originally released in August, 2011; 12 tracks; 42 min.) starts off with the 1 min. appetizer that is the title track, only then then dive into "Easy Way Out". The third track is "Somebody That I Used to Know", a duet with New Zealand singer Kimbra, and the single that has propelled this album out of obscurity last year into a megahit in Australia and Europe (check out also the video of this song, not to be missed!). "Smoke and Mirrors" is an irresitable stomper. "I Feel Better" sounds like Motown-revisted. "Don\'t Worry, We\'ll Be Watching You" is a reggae tune. The musical flavors are all over on this album, and as a result this is a very diverse-sounding and immensly enjoyable Gotye album.This album was released outside the US last August. I picked up the physical CD on a recent home visit to Belgium, where the album remains a top seller 5 months after its release. While the album has been available as an import here on Amazon, the album is finally getting a proper release in the US in early 2012. It\'s not too late to jump on the Gotye band wagon!

"Blunderbuss," his first official solo album, is top heavy with raucous guitars, southern-fried blues, big, liduid gutar fuzz-bomb solos, and White\'s odd view of the world. When your first song is about a woman who - literally - takes pieces of you with her, you know you\'re not in for your typical guitar hero album."Blunderbuss" tackles the radical sides of love almost as viciously as Marilyn Manson did on his new album. On the big noise of "Sixteen Saltines," White sings about the femme fatale whose "spiked heels put a hole in the lifeboat." Or "Love Interruption," the acoustic-ish number where White wants her so bad that he wants to turn "His friends into enemies." He\'s got it bad, and for us, that\'s good. Or the title track, where he moans that "doing what two people need is never on the menu."Along with the great guitar, While pulls out an oldie to play about with (and would have fit in just as nicely on his production of Wanda Jackson), "I\'m Shakin\'." Originally by bluesman Little Willie John (and well covered in the 80\'s by The Blasters), White gets playful, again about another questionable lady who\'ll make him \'noivous\' or get his locks clipped ala Samson and Delilah. While I certainly can\'t psychoanalyze the guy\'s "Blunderbuss" obsession with threatening women, I do hear the grooves in the album that he\'s inspired to make. His guitar is doing the bulk of the talking, the songs are all killer.
